# SKU Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to optimize SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) management by analyzing sales, stock levels, and customer ratings across various product categories. By identifying patterns in inventory management, stock turnover, and customer preferences, the goal is to streamline inventory processes, reduce overstocking and understocking, and increase overall revenue and profitability.

## Problem Statement

Inefficient SKU management can lead to overstocked or understocked inventory, causing missed revenue opportunities or unnecessary storage costs. Categories with high overstocking or understocking often lead to inventory imbalances, impacting the customer experience and company profitability. Identifying which SKUs need more attention and which categories can be optimized for better sales and stock turnover is critical for improving overall business efficiency.
**Goal:** Optimize SKU performance by categorizing SKUs into high-performing and low-performing segments, identifying factors influencing their performance, and recommending actionable strategies.
**Business Impact:** Improved inventory management, higher sales, reduced stock wastage, and better customer satisfaction.

## Plan of Action

### 1. Data Collection & Pre-processing
   - Gather data from sales, stock levels, revenue, and customer ratings across different product categories.
   - Clean and preprocess data for missing values and inconsistencies.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Perform analysis to uncover trends and patterns in SKU performance, customer ratings, and stock turnover.
   - Visualize sales by category and identify overstocked and understocked categories.

### 3. Stock and Sales Analysis
   - Create a scatter plot to identify the relationship between stock levels and sales performance across categories.
   - Calculate stock-to-sales ratios to measure stock efficiency.

### 4. Cross-Selling Opportunities
   - Analyze frequent product combinations purchased together to uncover potential for increasing basket size.

### 5. Actionable Insights
   - Provide recommendations on inventory optimization, targeted marketing for underperforming SKUs, and dynamic pricing strategies.

## Conclusion

The project successfully identifies key areas for SKU optimization, offering actionable insights to improve inventory turnover, minimize excess stock, and maximize sales potential. By optimizing stock levels, adjusting product assortments, and focusing on strategic pricing, the company can drive both operational efficiency and revenue growth.
